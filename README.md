Computing Ramsey Numbers with Genetic Algorithms
==============

to work on
-------
1. crossover
2. implement the actual genetic algorithm part
3. static var for clique size (prompt user) eg R(3,3) R(5,5) etc
4. if there is a graph that gets a 0 fitness (no same colored cliques), save that graph somehow for further inspection
