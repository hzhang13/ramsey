Computing Ramsey Numbers with Genetic Algorithms
==============

to work on
-------

1. fitness function
  - work on a more general fitness, how to input what we want? (eg R(3,3), R(5,5) etc)
  - see comments in Chromosome.java (use two loops)
2. crossover
3. implement the actual genetic algorithm part
